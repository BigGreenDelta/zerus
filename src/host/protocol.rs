//! Protocol 1 between hgs and the session host (spec D5).
//!
//! **Frames.** A connection is a sequence of frames: a `u32` little-endian length,
//! then exactly that many bytes, one kind byte followed by the payload. The length
//! counts the kind byte, so it is at least 1 and at most `MAX_FRAME`. Kind 0 holds
//! JSON (hello, requests, responses), kind 1 terminal bytes and kind 2 stream
//! control JSON. A frame error leaves the connection out of step: close it.
//!
//! **Hello.** The client's first frame is a `Hello` with the protocol majors it
//! speaks; the host answers with a `HelloAnswer`: its identity and the chosen major,
//! or a refusal. The hello shapes never change across majors.
//!
//! **Requests.** Then the client sends `Request`s, a numeric `id` and an `op`, and
//! the host answers each with a `Response` that repeats the id and carries `ok`
//! with the op's payload or `error` with a code and message. Changes within a
//! major are additive: unknown fields are ignored in both directions, an unknown op
//! decodes as `Op::Unsupported` (answered with `unsupported`, so a newer client can
//! degrade), and unknown error codes, roles and control messages decode too.
//!
//! **Stream mode.** After a successful `attach` both sides exchange only kind 1
//! (terminal bytes) and kind 2 (`Control`) frames. After `supervisor_register` the
//! direction turns: the host sends `Request<SupervisorOp>` frames and the
//! supervisor answers each with a `Response`.
